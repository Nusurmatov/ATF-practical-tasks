Modify the application from the first task of the Development and Build Tools
and C # by separating the functionality of counting the maximum number of 
unequal consecutive characters in a string into a separate method. Extend 
functionality by adding two more methods:
	1. determining the maximum number of consecutive identical letters 
	   of the Latin alphabet in a line
	2. determining the maximum number of consecutive identical digits
For each method, write Unit Tests (use the NUnit, XUnit or MSTest framework 
is your choice; follow AAA and FIRST). When creating tests, pay special 
attention to equivalence classes.
